SRC-> eks -> main.tf
in which i have added the comments and in that comment i have explained and added the task number how i implemented this so hope this would be well to understand 
As in the gitlab file there are four commands terraform init,terraform validate,terraform fmt,terraform plan these commands will automatically run when you push the code
clone the code and run terraform apply all of these resources will be running into your aws env by giving the correct access key id and secret access key id
